# Data Science World Happiness Score Estimator: Project Overview
* Used Kaggle World Happiness Report 2021 dataset. 
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, created graphs and charts.
* Created a model that estimates the ladder socre for a country.
* Optimized Random Forest Regressor by using GridSearchCV. 

Note: Project code is in the master branch.

## Code Used
* Python Version: 3.9
* Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas

## Data Insight 
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors â€“ economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. 
World Happiness Report 2021 dataset has the following relevant columns for each country:
* Country name
* Regional indicator
* Ladder score
* Logged GDP per capita
* Social support
* Healthy life expectancy
* Freedom to make life choices
* Generosity
* Perceptions of corruption

## EDA
I looked at the distributions of the data, correlations between variables and I plotted various graphs and charts to better undertsand the data.
Ladder scores' distribution is close to normal distribution.

## Model Building and Model Performance
First, I split the data into train and test sets with a test size of %20.

I tried Random Forest Regression model and  evaluated it usng Mean Absolute Error. 

RFR MAE: 0.462752

Since ladder scores change between 2.523-7.842 in the dataset, this is a relatively good error value.
